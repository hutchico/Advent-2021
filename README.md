# Advent-2021
Collection of solutions for the Advent of Code 2021.  
Complete problem descriptions and flavor text can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2021/  
Plan currently is to do most solutions in C#/.net and fall back to C++/Python where necessary.  
Per last year, work will stop when solutions become too complex to finish in a single day.  
Unlike last year, unfinished work will continue through the month of January.  
This repository will be made public on Febuary 1st, 2022.
